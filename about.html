        <h2>Family History and Early Life</h2>
        <p>I (<strong>SMBOND</strong>) was born on July 27, 2003 in SYLHET, BANGLADESH, to MD Sultan Mahmood, a retired govt officer and Fatema Jahan. I am the youngest of three children, with a brother and a sister. My family had a significant position in the parliament of the then Pakistan and early Bangladesh. My grandfather was a freedom fighter during the Liberation War of Bangladesh and was in charge of the mechanized infantry division of greater Sylhet. But due to an unprecedented incident, he was arrested and taken by the Pakistan army before he could join his forces. He died in 2010 and was given the prestigious guard of honor by the police and the military. His younger brother however, <a href="https://bn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A6%96%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%9A%E0%A7%8C%E0%A6%A7%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80#:~:text=%E0%A6%96%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%20%E0%A6%9A%E0%A7%8C%E0%A6%A7%E0%A7%81%E0%A7%81%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%20%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%A8%20%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0%20%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A8,%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A7%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BE%20%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E2%80%9D%20%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%20%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BE%20%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A5%A4"><strong>Dr. Khasruzzaman Chowdhury</strong></a> had finished his Phd. in Economics from the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwil0YbP0s6DAxUEUGwGHfj9ClYQFnoECBcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.syracuse.edu%2F&usg=AOvVaw233fp_N62QQsyvoMpQvPdr&opi=89978449"><strong>Syracuse University</strong></a> and <abbr title="Masters in Public Administration"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Public_Administration"><strong>MPA</strong></a></abbr> from the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwip3sfVjNCDAxVLr1YBHW1NAWEQFnoECB8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harvard.edu%2F&usg=AOvVaw3sANW3NhYzzRZ3MLnP1KOQ&opi=89978449"><strong>Harvard University</strong></a> in the United States.

            During my childhood, I grew up in a small locality, in the heart of Sylhet town. It was an area of peace and tranquility and the people in the whole locale was like a huge family. I passed my days mostly playing in the locale during the day after coming home from school. I made a bunch of friends there with whom I share wonderful memories.
